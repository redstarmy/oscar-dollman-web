Welcome to the repository for my personal website, [oscardollman.com](https://oscardollman.com)! This repository serves as a development hub for my personal website, functioning as both a gallery to showcase my photography work and a platform to introduce myself to the world.

## Technologies

It is built using a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend together with a simple [Express](https://expressjs.com/) backend, mainly to serve images. Deployment is also handled using Express. That way it can be deployed using a single lightweight Docker container from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/redstarmy/oscar-dollman-web/general)!

I'm a great fan of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), which is why both backend and frontend are written with strict type checking.
